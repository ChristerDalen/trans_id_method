# trans_id_method

Some MATLAB/Python functions are given for "old school" 80s transient model identification methods, i.e. methods assuming first order plus dead time or second order plus dead time models:

Yuwana Seborg (YS) (1982), see [1].
Jutan Rodriguez (JR) (1984), see [2].
Lee (1989), see [3].
Mamat & Flemming (MF) (1995), see [5].
Chen (1989), see [4].
FSL ()

which may be used to tune PI/PID controller if combined with traditional methods SIMC, Cohen-Coon, Tyreus-Luyben, Ziegler-Nichols etc.

The MATLAB files were implemented in connection with the following paper,
