# trans_id_method

Some MATLAB functions are given for "old school" transient model identificafion (i.e. FOPTD, SOPTD based) methods:

Yuwana Seborg (YS) (1982)
Jutan Rodriguez (JR) (1984)
Lee (1989)
Mamat & Flemming (MF) (1995)
Chen (1987)
FSL ()

which may be used to tune PI/PID controller if combined with traditional methods SIMC, Cohen-Coon, Tyreus-Luyben, Ziegler-Nichols etc.

The MATLAB files were implemented in connection with the following paper,
